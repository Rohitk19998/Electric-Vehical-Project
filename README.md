Electric Vehicle - Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Tableau)
Project Objective
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing EV adoption trends by model year, state, and manufacturer. Visualized top EV models, CAFV eligibility, and geographical distribution, highlighting key market insights. Demonstrated proficiency in data visualization and reporting.
Dataset Used
•	Dataset
Questions (KPIs)
•	What is the average electric range of EVs?
•	How many total electric vehicles (EVs), BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles), and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) are there?
•	Which EV make and model are the most popular?
•	What is the distribution of EVs across states?
Dashboard Interaction View Dashboard
Process
•	Data Aggregation - Data was grouped and aggregated by variables like vehicle make, model, year, and state to derive key insights.
•	Descriptive Analytics - Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Vehicles, Total BEV Vehicles, and Total PHEV Vehicles were calculated, alongside Average Electric Range. This provided an overview of the data for quick insights.
